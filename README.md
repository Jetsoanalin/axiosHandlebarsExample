# Axios Handlebars FS Example

## Note :
1. hbs [It's a handlebars template file which is a piece of HTML with handlebars tokens in it] files contain the HTML file template and the skeleton where the json file will be attached with.
2. json file is downloaded from the axios in task 1.
3. html file is created after the 2nd task is completed which will  be the final output.


## For Individual testing :

[You need NPM installed in your system]

Step 1: 
1. `node weatherTask1.js`
[gives output of json]

Step 2:
1. `node weatherTask2.js`
[gives output of the final HTML]

## For Final Showcase and to run both test at once :

`node finalserver.js`

1. You will be taken the template `finalweatheroutput.hbs` as a input
2. When 1st function runs you will get `finalworks.json` as a output
3. When 2nd function runs you will get `finalreport.html` as a output
